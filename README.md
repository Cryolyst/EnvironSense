# EnvironSense - Embedded Environmental Monitoring System

## Overview

EnvironSense is a compact Arduino-based environmental monitoring system that measures temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality using a BME680 sensor and displays real-time data on a 128×64 monochrome OLED display.

The system is built around an Arduino Nano and uses I²C communication to interface with both the BME680 sensor and the OLED display. Environmental data is presented through a lightweight, text-based embedded UI designed to operate within limited SRAM and processing constraints.

## Features

- Real-time display of temperature (°C/°F), relative humidity, air pressure, and an air quality proxy based on gas resistance
- I²C-based sensor and display communication
- Low-memory OLED interface using the U8x8 text-only graphics library
- Flicker-free UI updates with clear status indicators
- Interpretation of raw sensor data into qualitative environmental states (e.g., humidity and air quality levels)

## Design Focus 

This project emphasizes practical embedded systems concepts, including sensor integration, efficient memory usage, and firmware design under hardware constraints. Particular attention was given to balancing system simplicity with usability, resulting in a compact design that remains readable, responsive, and reliable.

## Components
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
- BME680 environmental sensor
- SSD1306 monochrome OLED display
- Power supply decoupling capacitors for the microcontroller and peripherals
- I²C pull-up resistors for shared bus stability

## Module Choices
This project was initially designed to use two separate sensors: a BME680 and an AHT20. The original plan was to use the BME680 for air quality and humidity measurements, while the AHT20 would be used exclusively for temperature sensing. This approach was intended to reduce potential temperature bias caused by the BME680’s internal gas sensor heater, which can slightly influence its onboard temperature readings.

Ultimately, the design was simplified to use only the BME680. As a 4-in-1 sensor, it provides temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality measurements within a single compact module, making it better suited for the size and layout constraints of this project. While the BME680’s temperature readings can be affected by internal heating, the resulting accuracy impact is minimal and acceptable for the intended application. The benefits of reduced system complexity and lower component count outweighed the marginal improvement offered by a separate temperature sensor.

To further mitigate heater-induced temperature bias, a duty-cycled gas heater control scheme was implemented in software. By periodically enabling the gas sensor heater rather than operating it continuously, internal heating effects are reduced, improving temperature accuracy without additional hardware.

## Component Usage

### Decoupling Capacitors
Decoupling capacitors are placed between VCC and GND near the Arduino Nano, BME680 sensor, and OLED module to stabilize the power supply and suppress high-frequency noise. They provide local charge storage to handle transient current demands from the components, improving voltage stability and ensuring reliable operation of the microcontroller and I²C peripherals.

### Pull-up Resistors
Pull-up resistors are used on the I²C SDA and SCL lines to ensure proper logic-high levels on the shared bus. They define the default high state when no device is actively pulling the line low, preventing floating signals and enabling stable communication between the Arduino Nano, BME680 sensor, and OLED display.

## I²C Communication

### SDA (Serial Data)
- Carries the actual data between devices  
- Used for sending and receiving bits  
- Bidirectional, allowing devices to both transmit and receive data  

### SCL (Serial Clock)
- Carries the clock signal  
- Generated by the master device (Arduino Nano)  
- Synchronizes when data on the SDA line is valid  

## What is I²C?
I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a two-wire communication protocol that allows a single microcontroller to communicate with multiple sensors and peripherals using shared data (SDA) and clock (SCL) lines.
